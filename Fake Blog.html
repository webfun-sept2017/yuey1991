          It was a typical sunny day in California. We were sweating under the black, medieval gowns waiting for the end of commencement. Diploma in hand, I felt a sense of relief. After 18 years of school from the age of 6, I finally get through all the exams, and graduated from one of my dream schools. A hunch came up that it might not be my last school education, but at that moment, all I was thinking was to step out of the campus and start a new life in a real business world. Who knows when my next exam would be?
          It did not take long for the answer. After one year working as a professional engineer, I realized that it is time for some recharge. And when I started to hunt for online learning opportunities, this online master program in Analytics caught my eyes immediately.
